# AI-Robot Brain - Perception and Decision Making

The AI-Robot Brain encompasses the perception and decision-making systems that allow robots to understand their environment and make intelligent choices. This is the core of autonomous behavior.

## Key Concepts

- **Perception**: Understanding the environment through sensors
- **Planning**: Determining a sequence of actions to achieve goals
- **Control**: Executing actions to achieve desired outcomes
- **Learning**: Improving performance over time

## Perception Systems

Robots use various sensors to perceive their environment:

- Cameras for vision
- LIDAR for distance measurement
- IMU for orientation
- Force/torque sensors for interaction

## Decision Making

Modern robots use AI techniques for decision making:

- Classical planning algorithms
- Machine learning approaches
- Reinforcement learning
- Deep neural networks

## Integration Challenges

Connecting perception to action requires careful system design to ensure real-time performance and safety.
