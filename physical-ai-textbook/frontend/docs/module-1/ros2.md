# ROS 2 - Robot Operating System

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

## Key Concepts

- **Nodes**: A node is a process that performs computation
- **Topics**: ROS data streams for passing information
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Goal-oriented communication with feedback

## Installation

To install ROS 2, follow the official installation guide for your operating system.

## Basic Architecture

ROS 2 uses a DDS (Data Distribution Service) implementation for communication between nodes. This provides better security and real-time capabilities compared to ROS 1.

## Working with ROS 2

In this module, you'll learn how to create nodes, publish and subscribe to topics, and use services to control your robot.
