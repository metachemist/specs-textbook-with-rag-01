# Digital Twin - Simulation and Modeling

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that mirrors the real-world counterpart throughout its lifecycle. In robotics, digital twins are crucial for testing, validation, and optimization.

## Key Concepts

- **Simulation**: Creating virtual environments to test robot behaviors
- **Modeling**: Representing physical systems mathematically
- **Synchronization**: Keeping the digital twin in sync with the physical system

## Simulation Platforms

Common simulation platforms include:

- Gazebo
- Unity
- Webots
- MuJoCo

## Benefits of Digital Twins

- Reduced development time
- Safer testing environment
- Cost-effective experimentation
- Predictive maintenance

## Working with Digital Twins

In this module, you'll learn how to create simulation environments and use them to test your robot algorithms before deploying to real hardware.
